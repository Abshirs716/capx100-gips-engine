## GIPS Structure: Firm → Composite → Accounts

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FIRM LEVEL - The RIA/Wealth Manager (e.g., "Vahanian & Associates")  │
│  • Claims GIPS compliance at FIRM level                                │
│  • Must include ALL discretionary, fee-paying accounts                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  COMPOSITE LEVEL - Groups of similar accounts (e.g., "Growth Equity")  │
│  • Accounts with SAME investment strategy grouped together             │
│  • Each composite has its own performance track record                 │
│  • This is what we SELL - composite performance presentations          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ACCOUNT LEVEL - Individual households/investors                       │
│  • Henderson Family Office ($208M)                                     │
│  • Smith Trust ($45M)                                                  │
│  • Each account assigned to appropriate composite(s)                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Answer to Your Question:
**GIPS is done at the COMPOSITE level, not individual household.**

However, we can offer BOTH services:

| Service | Description | Price |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Household Report** | Individual investor performance report (like we already have) | $500-1,000 |
| **GIPS Composite** | Real-slide GIPS-compliant presentation (multiple households combined) | **$7,500-15,000** |

## Client Intake Checklist

**What We Need From Every Client:**

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **1. Portfolio CSV Export** | YES | Holdings with ticker, shares, cost basis |
| **2. Management Fee Rate** | YES | Annual fee % (e.g., 1.00%, 0.75%) |
| **3. Composite Name** | YES | Strategy name (e.g., "Large Cap Growth") |
| **4. Firm Name** | YES | RIA/Firm legal name |
| **5. Benchmark** | Optional | Default: S&P 500 |
| **6. Total Firm AUM** | Optional | Default: Composite AUM |

### Fee Collection Script

> "To generate your GIPS-compliant presentation, I need two things:
> 1. A CSV export of your portfolio holdings from your custodian
> 2. Your management fee rate (the annual % you charge clients)
>
> If you're unsure about the fee, I'll use 1.00% which is industry standard for growth equity."

### Fee Defaults

| If Client Provides... | We Use... |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Specific fee rate (e.g., 0.85%) | Their rate exactly |
| "Around 1%" or vague | 1.00% |
| Nothing / "I don't know" | 1.00% (industry standard) |

### Why We Need the Fee

GIPS requires **Net-of-Fee Returns** alongside Gross Returns. The fee impact analysis shows:
- Gross Return vs Net Return comparison
- Cumulative fee drag over time
- Fee impact on wealth accumulation

**Example Output:**

| Year | Gross Return | Net Return | Fee Impact |
|------|--------------|------------|------------|
| 2024 | 15.2% | 14.2% | -1.00% |
| 2023 | 8.7% | 7.7% | -1.00% |
| 2022 | -12.3% | -13.3% | -1.00% |

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"We're too small for GIPS"** | "That's what [Firm] said before losing a $50M mandate to a GIPS-compliant competitor. At $7,500, can you afford NOT to have it?" |
| **"GIPS is too expensive"** | "Traditional consultants charge $50K+. We've automated 90% of the work - same output, $7,500. Want to see a sample?" |
| **"We don't need verification"** | "Most RIAs don't need verification - they just need GIPS-compliant presentations to respond to RFPs. That's exactly what we provide." |
| **"Will this pass verification?"** | "Absolutely. Same TWR calculations, same disclosures, same standards. We can provide a verification-ready package for $10,000." |
| **"We already have a consultant"** | "Great - how much are you paying annually? Most of our clients switched from $20K/year retainers to our $3,500 annual update. Same quality, 80% savings." |
| **"Can I see a sample?"** | "Absolutely. I'll send you a redacted GIPS presentation from a similar firm. You'll see it's Goldman Sachs quality." |
